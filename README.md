# DEUS OMNIUM CREATOR SECUM DEUM FECIT VISIBILEM ET HUNC FECIT PRIMUM ET SOLUM QUO OBLECTATUS EST ET VALDE AMAVIT PROPRIUM FILIUM QUI APPELLATUR SANCTUM VERBUM
God, the Creator of all, made God visible with himself, and made him the first and only one by which he was delighted and loved greatly by his own son, who is called the Holy Word.
