# DEUS OMNIUM CREATOR SECUM DEUM FECIT VISIBILEM ET HUNC FECIT PRIMUM ET SOLUM QUO OBLECTATUS EST ET VALDE AMAVIT PROPRIUM FILIUM QUI APPELLATUR SANCTUM VERBUM
God, the Creator of all, made God visible with himself, and made him the first and only one by which he was delighted and loved greatly by his own son, who is called the Holy Word.

حق لا شك فيه صحيح

إن الأعلى من الأسفل والأسفل من الأعلى

عمل العجائب من واحد كما كانت الأشياء كلها من واحد بتدبير واحد
#
Verum sine mendacio, certum, et verissimum.

Quod est inferius, est sicut quod est superius.

Et quod est superius, est sicut quod est inferius, ad perpetranda miracula rei unius.

Et sicut res omnes fuerunt ab uno, meditatione unius, sic omnes res natae ab hac una re, adaptatione.
#
Tis true without lying, certain and most true.

That which is below is like that which is above and that which is above is like that which is below

to do the miracle of one only thing

And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
